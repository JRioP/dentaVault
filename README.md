## 📖 Overview
**DentaVault (Dentify)** is a robust desktop application designed to digitize administrative tasks for dental clinics.

Traditional paper-based clinic management often leads to lost records, disorganized scheduling, and inventory errors. **DentaVault** solves this by providing a secure environment for **patient record keeping**, **appointment scheduling**, **treatment tracking**, and **prescription management**—all within a unified interface.

From secure staff login to detailed patient history logging, DentaVault ensures that dental practitioners can focus on patient care rather than paperwork.
